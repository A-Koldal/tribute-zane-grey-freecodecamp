			Pearl Zane Grey is better known as the American author who penned novels and stories that presented images of the American Frontier. Many might not know of Grey’s exploits as a pioneering angler. He is a one-time holder of over a dozen saltwater records. Grey went on to master the methods to catch the broadbill swordfish that is very elusive in nature. Zane Grey was a champion in reeling a sailfish using the tight tackle. Grey spent a lot of his time, energy and resources for his passion of fishing that led Ed Zern to write about Grey as, “No other man … has devoted so much of his fortune, or so large a share of his time and energy, to the catching of fish for the sport of it.”
